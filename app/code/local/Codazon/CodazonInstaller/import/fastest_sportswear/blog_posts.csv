<p>For the Nike Women's Training Spring 2012 collection, we asked Nike athletes and trainers to examine the way they train and look for the commonalities in their range of motion. Our designers then used innovation and design to develop a collection of footwear and apparel that enhances each one of the 6 CORE MOVES by providing zero distraction and technological details that are hidden in the beauty of a unique design aesthetic.</p>

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it&rsquo;s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won&rsquo;t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s made from a lightweight fabric blend with a ribbed texture and hugs the contours of the body, flattering your shape. An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment. In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.</p>

<p>The tight, seamless fit helps support the muscles and flatters the figure. At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won&rsquo;t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.</p>

<p>These eye-catching shorts consist of two layers, which work together for comfort, freedom of movement, and sweat management. The outer short is a Dri-FIT taffeta fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) that wicks sweat away to the surface of the short and dries quickly. This fabric also has a two-way stretch for an athletic fit and a side hem vent that keeps legs unrestricted when performing core moves such as the Lunge or Bend. The inner compression short and gusset is a soft Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix in a contrasting color) which wicks sweat away from the skin. Design features such as the elastic waistband and external drawcord ensure a snug, secure fit, lying flat on the body for a more flattering silhouette, while the flat seam construction reduces chaffing.</p>

<p>The established Nike Pro apparel uses the Dri-FIT technology which wicks sweat away from the skin to the surface of the garment to help keep you dry and minimize irritation during tough workouts, and incorporates flat-seam construction to help reduce irritation caused by chaffing. For Spring 2012, the weight of the stretch jersey fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) has been increased to make it more robust allowing it to be worn as an outer layer as well as under team uniforms. The compression fit of the pants offers great support, with a secure elastic waistband and internal gusset for comfort. The range includes the 18.5 inch capris, funky 2.5-inch short print, bright and bold 5-inch short. These are complemented by the racer-style Nike Pro Bra, which offers freedom of movement while using its compression fit and nylon stabilizers in the bra straps to provide the level of support needed for a medium-impact training session that might involve running, and multidirectional movement.</p>

The Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix) hugs the body but also wicks sweat away from the skin keeping you cool, dry and comfortable. The positioning of the side seams keeps the top streamline and simple and the longer body not only elongates the look, but also keeps your rear covered when you Bend or Squat. Raglan sleeves allow arms and shoulders to move freely in moves such as the Pull while an underarm gusset and flat seam keep you comfortable. Tops come in an extensive range of block colors, with a subtle Nike swoosh on the breast. Attractive on its own, this slim-fit top is also great for layering with a jacket or team uniform.</p>

<p>For the Nike Women's Training Spring 2012 collection, we asked Nike athletes and trainers to examine the way they train and look for the commonalities in their range of motion. Our designers then used innovation and design to develop a collection of footwear and apparel that enhances each one of the 6 CORE MOVES by providing zero distraction and technological details that are hidden in the beauty of a unique design aesthetic.</p>

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it&rsquo;s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won&rsquo;t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment. In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.</p>

At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won&rsquo;t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.</p>

The outer short is a Dri-FIT taffeta fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) that wicks sweat away to the surface of the short and dries quickly. This fabric also has a two-way stretch for an athletic fit and a side hem vent that keeps legs unrestricted when performing core moves such as the Lunge or Bend. The inner compression short and gusset is a soft Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix in a contrasting color) which wicks sweat away from the skin. Design features such as the elastic waistband and external drawcord ensure a snug, secure fit, lying flat on the body for a more flattering silhouette, while the flat seam construction reduces chaffing.</p>

The outer short is a Dri-FIT taffeta fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) that wicks sweat away to the surface of the short and dries quickly. This fabric also has a two-way stretch for an athletic fit and a side hem vent that keeps legs unrestricted when performing core moves such as the Lunge or Bend.

For Spring 2012, the weight of the stretch jersey fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) has been increased to make it more robust allowing it to be worn as an outer layer as well as under team uniforms. The compression fit of the pants offers great support, with a secure elastic waistband and internal gusset for comfort. The range includes the 18.5 inch capris, funky 2.5-inch short print, bright and bold 5-inch short. These are complemented by the racer-style Nike Pro Bra, which offers freedom of movement while using its compression fit and nylon stabilizers in the bra straps to provide the level of support needed for a medium-impact training session that might involve running, and multidirectional movement.</p>

The Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix) hugs the body but also wicks sweat away from the skin keeping you cool, dry and comfortable. The positioning of the side seams keeps the top streamline and simple and the longer body not only elongates the look, but also keeps your rear covered when you Bend or Squat. Raglan sleeves allow arms and shoulders to move freely in moves such as the Pull while an underarm gusset and flat seam keep you comfortable. Tops come in an extensive range of block colors, with a subtle Nike swoosh on the breast. Attractive on its own, this slim-fit top is also great for layering with a jacket or team uniform.</p>

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it&rsquo;s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won&rsquo;t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment. In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.</p>

At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won&rsquo;t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.</p>

<p>A flattering V-neck top that creates an elegant slimline silhouette. The Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix) hugs the body but also wicks sweat away from the skin keeping you cool, dry and comfortable. The positioning of the side seams keeps the top streamline and simple and the longer body not only elongates the look, but also keeps your rear covered when you Bend or Squat. Raglan sleeves allow arms and shoulders to move freely in moves such as the Pull while an underarm gusset and flat seam keep you comfortable. Tops come in an extensive range of block colors, with a subtle Nike swoosh on the breast. Attractive on its own, this slim-fit top is also great for layering with a jacket or team uniform.</p>

<p>For the Nike Women's Training Spring 2012 collection, we asked Nike athletes and trainers to examine the way they train and look for the commonalities in their range of motion. Our designers then used innovation and design to develop a collection of footwear and apparel that enhances each one of the 6 CORE MOVES by providing zero distraction and technological details that are hidden in the beauty of a unique design aesthetic.</p>

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it&rsquo;s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won&rsquo;t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s made from a lightweight fabric blend with a ribbed texture and hugs the contours of the body, flattering your shape. An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment. In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.</p>

<p>The tight, seamless fit helps support the muscles and flatters the figure. At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won&rsquo;t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.</p>

<p>These eye-catching shorts consist of two layers, which work together for comfort, freedom of movement, and sweat management. The outer short is a Dri-FIT taffeta fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) that wicks sweat away to the surface of the short and dries quickly. This fabric also has a two-way stretch for an athletic fit and a side hem vent that keeps legs unrestricted when performing core moves such as the Lunge or Bend. The inner compression short and gusset is a soft Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix in a contrasting color) which wicks sweat away from the skin. Design features such as the elastic waistband and external drawcord ensure a snug, secure fit, lying flat on the body for a more flattering silhouette, while the flat seam construction reduces chaffing.</p>

<p>The established Nike Pro apparel uses the Dri-FIT technology which wicks sweat away from the skin to the surface of the garment to help keep you dry and minimize irritation during tough workouts, and incorporates flat-seam construction to help reduce irritation caused by chaffing. For Spring 2012, the weight of the stretch jersey fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) has been increased to make it more robust allowing it to be worn as an outer layer as well as under team uniforms. The compression fit of the pants offers great support, with a secure elastic waistband and internal gusset for comfort. The range includes the 18.5 inch capris, funky 2.5-inch short print, bright and bold 5-inch short. These are complemented by the racer-style Nike Pro Bra, which offers freedom of movement while using its compression fit and nylon stabilizers in the bra straps to provide the level of support needed for a medium-impact training session that might involve running, and multidirectional movement.</p>

"Learning to Love Again",,"When I began the trail, I knew that I would miss the regular physical contact that I had with people in sedentary life. Everything from high fives, fist bumps, hugs, and handshakes – I would miss it all. Little did I know how strange and how hard it would be to feel love without that simple physical contact.
Disclaimer – you might want to read up on the 5 love languages if you’re slightly confused about what I am talking about. A simple Google search should suffice.
While on trail, besides ticks and bears, the thing that hikers fear most is Norovirus – imagine having a stomach bug for three days and not being able to eat anything while losing it all. Being a virus, it is spread through human contact with anyone or anything that is infected or has come into contact with it. For this reason, among others, you don’t shake hands, high five, fist bump, give hugs, and you make sure to actively avoid contact if possible.
Being someone who feels love through those simple interactions, it was so strange for me to not shake people’s hands when I met them or to congratulate people with hugs or high fives. It felt was as though I was being isolated from people even though I was in close proximity with them every day.
The good news is that physical contact isn’t the only love language. I found myself trying to love others and to be loved in ways that were not my primary languages. Whenever someone did trail magic, not only did I feel overjoyed, but there was a deeper sense of appreciation and gratitude that made me feel cared for and loved. If someone threw my bear line for me, I would feel the same thing – something deeper than service and gifts.
I see how the other love languages are more active in my life and think about how the trail isn’t just teaching my legs how to do big miles, or my brain to spend time in silence and though, but that it is changing me. It is changing the way that I can be loved and how I can adapt to be loved in almost every situation.
As someone wise once wrote, “these three remain – faith, hope, and love, but the greatest of these is love”.",2,learning-to-love-again,"Scommerce Mage","Fator Designer",,"First! A giant shout out to Cindy and her family whom I met in the Shennadoahs for taking my brother and I into their home as if we were family instead of just some smelly hikers. Thank you so much – this post comes a lot from our interactions! This post has been a long time coming – so here it is.",codazon_blog/codazon_blog_1465939521.jpg
"As you begin your journey",,"Probably a little late to give a “send-off” to this year’s class, but I wanted to write something that I wish someone had told me in the beginning.
I can say that my second half of the hike was a lot more fun than the first half. Not going into town as often and not finding people that I really connected with. Do your best to find that early. Having this discussion with a fellow thru-hiker Lightning, we came to the conclusion that the thing we missed the most was the people. The kind of motivated, stubborn, people with a mission are hard to come by in the workplace. Getting a group of people together with a single mission, that won’t let the others fail, is not found in a lot of places.
Remember as you press on, that all your experiences out there are better shared.
Each summit, every weird trail town, all the beers, are improved by having fellow hikers around. Shared suffering and the shared joys are what made this hike so special.",2,as-you-begin-your-journey,"Scommerce Mage","Fator Designer",,"I spent and spend hours and hours on this site researching gear, and just realizing it was and is possible.

When Zach asked me to write about the hike, it really motivated me to actually do this thing. Nothing sadder than seeing the bloggers who just drop off.",codazon_blog/codazon_blog_1465939394.jpg
