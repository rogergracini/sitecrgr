<div class=""std"">
<p>Uniquely designed with cosmopolitan appeal, Madison Island gives couture-conscious frequent flyers exactly what they want&mdash;unprecedented access to the latest looks of the season, style solutions for easy international jet setting, and convenient worldwide delivery.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 13px;"">With its website relaunch in 2013, Madison Island has solidified its standing as the new essential luxury. Its pages are filled with exquisite finds for fashion and home.</p>
<p><strong>The History:</strong></p>
<p>Formed by London College of Fashion graduates Holly Wang and her team in 2009, Miss Patina has continued to grow rapidly due to the fact it fills a niche in the fashion world for good quality vintage inspired goods.</p>
<p><strong>The Concept</strong></p>
<p>Miss Patina&rsquo;s design concept&nbsp;is to create individual clothing with elements of vintage glamour, whilst focusing on intricate details, such as lace or mesh overlays, brocade and embroidery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspirations for design are taken from previous iconic fashions and fused with today&rsquo;s catwalk trends. Inspired by vintage and a love for art, design and culture, there are many styles that Miss Patina caters to.</p>
<p><a href=""http://misspatina.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Miss-Patina-LOGO-Shell-Small.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8735 aligncenter"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" alt=""Miss Patina LOGO Shell Small"" src=""http://misspatina.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Miss-Patina-LOGO-Shell-Small.jpg"" height=""90"" width=""120"" /></a></p>
<p><em>Logo</em>: Our scalloped shell is inspired by the birth of Venus, and its reference to the setting sun. The scalloped shell is uniquely feminine and elegant and is frequently displayed in the designs of Miss Patina clothing.</p>
<p><em>Patina Green</em>: &nbsp;The sheen produced on surfaces through age, represents our influence from past decades, whilst the colour is associated with rococo art, and represents our highly decorative nature. Patina is the beauty of time and comes from a life lived.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Today:</strong></p>
<p>Miss Patina has frequently been featured in many fashion publications including Vogue, Grazia, Look, Company, Glamour and Cosmopolitan, and has been worn by fashion favourites, such as Taylor Swift, Elle Fanning, British actress Sienna Miller, Emilia Clarke, Jenna Coleman, singer Pixie Lott, Una Foden, model Suki Waterhouse, and UK TV presenter Caroline Flack, Alice Levine and Alex Jones.</p>
<p>With more than 100 stores and boutiques around the world &nbsp;including 11 Topshop concessions and stockists throughout the UK, Europe, Asia, and USA, Miss Patina is continually catching the attention of vintage and fashion enthusiasts around the world.</p>

"Reward Points",two_columns_left,,,reward-points,"Reward Points","<p>The Reward Points Program allows you to earn points for certain actions you take on the site. Points are awarded based on making purchases and customer actions such as submitting reviews.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Reward Points for Registered Customers</h2>
<p>Once you register you will be able to earn and accrue reward points, which are then redeemable at time of purchase towards the cost of your order. Rewards are an added bonus to your shopping experience on the site and just one of the ways we thank you for being a loyal customer.</p>

<h2>Earning Reward Points</h2>
<p>Rewards can currently be earned for the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making purchases — every time you make a purchase you earn points based on the price of products purchased and these points are added to your Reward Points balance.</li>
<li>Registering on the site.</li>
<li>Subscribing to a newsletter for the first time.</li>
<li>Sending Invitations — Earn points by inviting your friends to join the site.</li>
<li>Converting Invitations to Customer — Earn points for every invitation you send out which leads to your friends registering on the site.</li>
<li>Converting Invitations to Order — Earn points for every invitation you send out which leads to a sale.</li>
<li>Review Submission — Earn points for submitting product reviews.</li>
<li>New Tag Submission — Earn points for adding tags to products.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reward Points Exchange Rates</h2>
<p>The value of reward points is determined by an exchange rate of both currency spent on products to points, and an exchange rate of points earned to currency for spending on future purchases.</p>

<h2>Redeeming Reward Points</h2>
<p>You can redeem your reward points at checkout. If you have accumulated enough points to redeem them you will have the option of using points as one of the payment methods.  The option to use reward points, as well as your balance and the monetary equivalent this balance, will be shown to you in the Payment Method area of the checkout.  Redeemable reward points can be used in conjunction with other payment methods such as credit cards, gift cards and more.</p>


<h2>Reward Points Minimums and Maximums</h2>
<p>Reward points may be capped at a minimum value required for redemption.  If this option is selected you will not be able to use your reward points until you accrue a minimum number of points, at which point they will become available for redemption.</p>
<p>Reward points may also be capped at the maximum value of points which can be accrued. If this option is selected you will need to redeem your accrued points before you are able to earn more points.</p>

<h2>Managing My Reward Points</h2>
<p>You have the ability to view and manage your points through your <a href=""{{store url=""customer/account""}}"">Customer Account</a>. From your account you will be able to view your total points (and currency equivalent), minimum needed to redeem, whether you have reached the maximum points limit and a cumulative history of points acquired, redeemed and lost. The history record will retain and display historical rates and currency for informational purposes. The history will also show you comprehensive informational messages regarding points, including expiration notifications.</p>


<h2>Reward Points Expiration</h2>
<p>Reward points can be set to expire. Points will expire in the order form which they were first earned.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can sign up to receive email notifications each time your balance changes when you either earn, redeem or lose points, as well as point expiration notifications. This option is found in the <a href=""{{store url=""reward/customer/info""}}"">Reward Points section</a> of the My Account area.</p>
